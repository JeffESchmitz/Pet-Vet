# PetVet
5th Project of Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree

### Project Description: 
In this capstone project, students will create an app of their own design that showcases our iOS development skills.

### App Description:
PetVet is an iOS Application that allows pet owners to record and store information about the furrier members of their family. No, not Dad! Their pets!

Main Features include:
* Add/Edit/Delete Pets
* Add/Delete Weight Records
* Search for Breed Names using PetFinder.com's API
* View current information about each Pet (example: Age)

#### User Interface Requirements:
* More than one view controller
* A table or collection view
* Navigation and modal presentation
* Image assets in 1x, 2x, and 3x formats. Or in vector format.

#### Networking Requirements:
* Choose an API and integrate downloaded data into the app
* Give users feedback around network activity, displaying activity indicators and/or progress bars when appropriate, and an alert in case of connection failures
* Encapsulate networking code in a class to reduce detail in View Controllers

#### Persistence Requirements: 
* Include an object graph that can be persisted in Core Data
* Manage the Core Data Stack outside of your view controllers, either in the App Delegate or in a separate Core Data Stack manager class
* Aside from your primary app state, you should find some additional state that can be stored outside of Core Data, either in NSUserDefaults, or in the documents directory using an NSKeyedArchiver

#### README Requirements:
* Describe the intended user experience
* Include all specific actions and/or commands necessary for the reviewer to compile, run, and access any aspect of the project

### Requirements to Use:
* Xcode 7.0, Swift 2.0

### Future Enhancements:
* More to come!
